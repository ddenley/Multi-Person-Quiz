- intent: contest
  examples: |
    - you are wrong, it is [French Polynesia](GPE)
    - I don't think so, it is [Saint Kitts and Nevis](GPE)
    - I disagree, it must be [Kazakhstan](GPE)
    - No it is [Ukraine](GPE)
    - you are mistaken, it is [Honduras](GPE)
    - no it is not [Ireland](GPE)
    - i think not, it must be [Bonaire](GPE)
    - it cannot be [Malta](GPE)

    - Arabic kind of writing on the flag, and so I'm suspecting [Oman](GPE) or [Brunei](GPE)
    - Ohh I know it's not [Senegal](GPE)
    - Hmmm
    - That I am sure
    - I don't think it is [Peru](GPE), I feel like [Peru](GPE) has a green in it, and I think it is horizontal
    - Why don't, um, I think it is [Australia](GPE), but I don't know like shouldn't the other flag be like in the corner, right? Shouldn't be in the background.
    - it is because [Australia](GPE) is still a number of the Commonwealth I believe. They and [New Zealand](GPE)
    - it's not [Israel](GPE) or [option A](GPE)
    - It's not [Israel](GPE) and [Algeria](GPE) should be green
    - yeah
    - The only country I know it is not is [Serbia](GPE)
    - ohh neither none of these nations are Carribean or right like it's not somewhere in the Middle East to eastern Asia
    - [Mongolia](GPE) is above [China](GPE) I believe 
    - And [Guyana](GPE) is somewhere north of [Australia](GPE)
    - But I don't know anything about [Turkmenistan](GPE), so it could just be that and I've I have no idea.
    - I'm going to pretend this doesn't matter to me
    - It’s not [Ireland](GPE)
    - I don't think it's [Sudan](GPE) either
    - I don't believe it is that either, so our options are the [Gambia](GPE) or [Saint Kitts and Nevis](GPE)
    - for me it's 50 50 i guess
    - I’m trying to think, because, like all of West Africa usually just goes vertical
    - North Africa goes like playing with some symbol on it
    - Besides [Egypt](GPE), [Egypt](GPE) is different. For some reason, um South
    - And yet I don't feel like it is [Saint Kitts and Nevis](GPE)
    - It's not [Israel](GPE). It's definitely not [Congo](GPE)
    - It's not [Bangladesh](GPE) either
    - Yeah I don't think that's it either
    - Because I’m Nigerian, I know that’s not [Nigeria](GPE)
    - Nice, I also, I'm almost certain it's not [Haiti](GPE) either
    - Can we zoom in there
    - That look’s French
    - questions are [Haiti](GPE), [Maldives](GPE) or [Honduras](GPE)? I don't think it's [Honduras](GPE). I feel like [Honduras](GPE) is blue and white for some reason.
    - It’s definitely not [Mexico](GPE) or [Ukraine](GPE)
    - It seems like an actually a bit of an easier one based on the options
    - We've just seen [Colombia](GPE), so we know it's not that
    - It’s not [Switzerland](GPE) either
    - I don’t think it’s [Indonesia](GPE)
