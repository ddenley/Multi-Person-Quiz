# A multi-person collaborative flag quiz for social robots in public spaces.

This is the code related with our study on : multi-person collaborative flag quiz for social robots in public spaces.

*Conversational agents participating in multi-party interactions face significant challenges in dialogue state tracking since the identity of the speaker adds significant contextual meaning.  It is common to utilise diarisation models to identify the speaker.  However, it is not clear these are sufficiently accurate to correctly identify specific conversational events such asagreement or disagreement during a real-time interaction. This study uses a cooperative quiz,where the conversational agent acts as quiz-show host, to determine whether diarisation or a frequency and proximity based method is more accurate at determining agreement and whether this translates to feelings of engagement in the players. Experimental results show that while diarisation can work well, it is not currently accurate and consistent enough to provide a sufficiently engaging experience during real co-operative discussion and that a frequency and proximity-based method is preferred by players.*
